## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Data for the chart is provided in a local `data.json` file. 

Users can:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file
